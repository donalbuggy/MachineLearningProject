# MachineLearningProject
This is the repository for the Machine Learning project 2023.

The repository consists of four notebooks:
* keras_tsa_detection.ipynb -- containing a practical exercise replicating a time-series anomaly detection from the Keras website and exploring the Keras functions used.
* models_exercises -- containing two exercises in using using Python to model datasets and statistical information.
* parameters_exercises -- containing one exercise in using Numpy's polyfit function to fit polynomials to two datasets.
* statistics_exercises -- containing three exercises using Python to explore statsitical decision-making and hypothesis-testing.

References for each exercise are contained in the respective notebooks. The lecturer's notebooks were referred to extensively and may be found here: https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/2223-S1-machine-learn-stats/tree/main/notebooks
